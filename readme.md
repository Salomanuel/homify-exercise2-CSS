# Exercise​ ​2​ ​-​ ​CSS:​ ​Implement​ ​style​ ​from​ ​example
Given the `example.png` image of a page header, implement it with `logo.png`, `homify_header.html`
and `style.css` to look as similar as possible, changing the html markup as little as possible (note
that `style.css` is empty on purpose).
